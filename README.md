# Trip-Planner-Using-Dijkstra
Smart Trip Planner Using Dijkstra 🚗🌍 is a Python-based application that simplifies and optimizes travel planning. This app uses advanced algorithms like Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between cities, enhancing route planning by considering distance, time, and cost. 🗺️✨

The application integrates Nominatim API 🌐 for fetching accurate coordinates of source and destination cities and OpenRouteService API 🚦 to calculate routes, distances, and travel times. Users can input their source and destination cities and select from different transport modes—🚗 Car, 🚲 Bike, or 🚌 Bus—each providing customized estimates for travel time and cost. 💸

With Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the app dynamically calculates the most efficient route, optimizing the journey and ensuring minimal travel time and cost. The interface is designed using Tkinter 🖥️ for a simple, user-friendly experience, allowing users to easily plan their trips with ease. Additionally, the app includes reverse geocoding 🔍, allowing it to identify cities and locations along the route, providing more context for the traveler.

This tool is ideal for individuals looking to plan road trips, daily commutes, or educational projects related to transportation and logistics. Smart Trip Planner showcases the power of Python 🐍, algorithm design, and API integration to deliver a smooth and efficient travel planning experience. Whether you’re planning an adventure or optimizing your route for daily use, this app ensures your trip is as efficient as possible. 🚀🌟
